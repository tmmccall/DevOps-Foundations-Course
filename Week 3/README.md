# Week 3: Advanced Docker Concepts and Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## Overview

This week we dive deeper into Docker's advanced functionalities, focusing on:
- Docker Compose
- Docker Networks 
- and, Docker Volumes. 

Additionally, We will explore _microservices architecture_ and _fundamentals of cloud computing_. By learning these concepts you will gain a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage advanced techniques to interconnect and enhance application deployment and scalability.


## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement multi-container applications using Docker Compose.
- Configure and manage Docker Networks for container communication.
- Understand usage of Docker Volumes for persistent data storage.
- Understand the principles of Microservices Architecture.
- Grasp the basics of Cloud Computing and its impact on modern IT infrastructure.


## Contents

- **`README.md`**: Overview and instructions for `Week 3` materials.
- **`DevOps Foundations-Session 3 Slides.pdf`**: In-person session presentation slides.


> **Note**: This week does not include a dedicated practice exercise, because the `Project/` serves as an integrated exercise covering concepts from both Week 2 and Week 3. It is highly recommended to complete the Project to effectively understand and apply the Docker and CI/CD concepts learned.
